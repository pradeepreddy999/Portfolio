      ## The Challenge
      Multiple teams building the flagship One Retail platform were duplicating UI components with inconsistent styling and behavior, slowing down feature delivery and hurting UI consistency across the product.

      ## The Solution
      Spearheaded the company's first reusable React + TypeScript component library, published as a versioned package via an Azure Artifacts feed. Integrated Storybook for interactive documentation and testing, centralizing common UI components and streamlining onboarding for new developers.

      ## The Impact
      Reduced component duplication and accelerated feature delivery across multiple teams. The library was adopted company-wide, setting a foundation for scalable, maintainable, and themeable UI development.

      ## The Challenge
      Walmart stores needed a smarter way to order from vendors and distribution centers — one that reduced stockouts and excess inventory across Vendor to Store, Vendor to DC, and DC to Store flows.

      ## The Solution
      Contributed to the design and development of applications that optimize Walmart store orders, implementing core backend logic in .NET Core 8 Web API and SQL Server to streamline order flows. Enhanced the ordering process by integrating real-time sales and inventory data to generate intelligent order suggestions.

      ## The Impact
      Helped reduce stockouts and optimize inventory costs by improving order planning and execution, while collaborating with the team through the full software development lifecycle from design to deployment.

      ## The Challenge
      Vendors needed a clear, self-service way to understand Walmart deduction activity, which was previously a manual and opaque reconciliation process.

      ## The Solution
      Developed front-end interfaces in React.js using Redux Toolkit for Walmart's vendor deduction management system, building user-friendly dashboards that surface deduction insights. Integrated the front-end modules with a .NET Core 7 Web API backend to ensure smooth data exchange, including user-customizable theming for improved usability.

      ## The Impact
      Improved accuracy and reduced manual reconciliation effort, contributing to increased vendor adoption of the tool.
